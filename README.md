# Prim's Algorithm Simulation

An interactive web-based visualization tool for **Prim's Algorithm**, designed to help understand the construction of a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** using step-by-step animation and user-created graphs.

## 🔍 Features

- Create custom graphs by specifying the number of nodes and manually placing them.
- Add weighted edges between nodes visually.
- Step-by-step simulation of Prim's Algorithm.
- Color-coded edge status:
  - 🟢 Green: Accepted MST edges
  - 🟠 Orange: Currently considered edges
  - 🔴 Red: Rejected edges
  - ⚪ Gray: Unused edges
- Reset and restart graph creation any time.

## 🚀 Live Demo
